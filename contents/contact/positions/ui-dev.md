#Developer / Mad Scientist

iF is looking for a coder who likes to tinker. If you have front-end skills (HTML5, CSS, D3, Javascript, jQuery etc.) and want to develop, experiment and advise on interactive technologies, iF is looking for you. Our work spans the gamut from prototypes and proofs of concept to complex, comprehensive interactive experiences.

The ideal candidate is somewhere between green and grizzled â€“ and gets as fired up thinking about technical strategy as they do technical development envisioning smarter, simpler, original solutions that will make the world a better place.
